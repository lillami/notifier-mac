# notifier-mac
It notifies you if you have only few space on the used the disk. The code is not ready yet.

My idea was, when I must consider to save my data and empty the disk in my computer to make a notification for that.
Here I have set it to 10%, because then we still have enough time to handle.

The code I havent finished yet, I would like to build in:
- a repetition for every day or week
- and (no idea how) to make that it runs in the background and doesnt slow down the computer?
